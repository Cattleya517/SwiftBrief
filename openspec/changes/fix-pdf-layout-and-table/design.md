## Context

The PDF is generated by html2canvas (DOM → canvas) + jsPDF (canvas → PDF). Current margins are 20mm top/bottom and 15mm left/right, leaving 257mm content height on A4 (297mm). The petition content with one note typically fits close to one page but sometimes overflows due to the large top margin.

The note details table uses Tailwind classes `border-collapse border border-black` on `<table>` and `border border-black` on each `<th>`/`<td>`. html2canvas sometimes fails to render `border-collapse` tables correctly, producing missing or doubled borders.

## Goals / Non-Goals

**Goals:**
- Reduce top/bottom margins to maximize content area
- Make single-note petitions fit on one page
- Fix table borders in PDF to match preview

**Non-Goals:**
- Changing the preview layout or styling
- Supporting content that genuinely requires multiple pages on a single page

## Decisions

### Reduce margins to 10mm top, 10mm bottom

Standard legal documents in Taiwan typically use 15-25mm margins. 10mm is tight but acceptable for a petition. This gives 277mm content height — enough for most single-note petitions.

### Fix table borders via inline styles in onclone

Rather than patching html2canvas's table rendering, apply explicit inline border styles to all `<table>`, `<th>`, and `<td>` elements in the cloned DOM during the onclone callback. This ensures html2canvas sees the borders directly rather than relying on CSS class resolution.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- [10mm margins may be too tight for some courts] → Can be adjusted back if needed; 15mm is a safe fallback
- [Inline border styles may override intended styling] → Only applied in the cloned DOM for PDF capture, not the live preview
